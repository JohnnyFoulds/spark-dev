# Apache Spark Development Environment
Setting up a simple Apache Spark environment used for working with Spark in a development environment.

On the [References](wiki/References) page there are resources to help setting up a Apache Spark cluster. This is however not the goal of this project and the intend is to simply build something lightweight that can be spun up as quick as possible to start using Spark.
